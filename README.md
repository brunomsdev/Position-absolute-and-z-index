# Position: absolute and z-index

"Position: absolute" is a powerful property for positioning an element on a webpage. It takes the image/element from its natural flow, i.e., the image will be in a different layer, which could make them overlap. This simple project explains how it works, how to place it, and how to move the elements through layers.

There are important properties used with "position: absolute". They are: "top", "right", "bottom", "left", "z-index". The first four properties are used to place the element on the webpage. That's extremely useful to make better designs by positioning elements in specific places of a website. The z-index is a property that define the specific layer of an element to decide which element is on top of the other.
